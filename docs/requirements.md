# CollabCanvas Requirements

## Section 1: Core Collaborative Infrastructure

### Real-Time Synchronization
- Sub-100ms object sync
- Sub-50ms cursor sync
- Zero visible lag during rapid multi-user edits

### Conflict Resolution & State Management
- Two users edit same object simultaneously → both see consistent final state
- Documented strategy (last-write-wins, CRDT, OT, etc.)
- No "ghost" objects or duplicates
- Rapid edits (10+ changes/sec) don't corrupt state
- Clear visual feedback on who last edited

### Persistence & Reconnection
- User refreshes mid-edit → returns to exact state
- All users disconnect → canvas persists fully
- Network drop (30s+) → auto-reconnects with complete state
- Operations during disconnect queue and sync on reconnect
- Clear UI indicator for connection status

#### Testing Scenarios for Persistence:
- **Mid-Operation Refresh**: User drags object, refreshes browser mid-drag → object position preserved
- **Total Disconnect**: All users close browsers, wait 2 minutes, return → full canvas state intact
- **Network Simulation**: Throttle network to 0 for 30 seconds, restore → canvas syncs without data loss
- **Rapid Disconnect**: User makes 5 rapid edits, immediately closes tab → edits persist for other users

## Section 2: Canvas Features & Performance

### Canvas Functionality
- Smooth pan/zoom
- 3+ shape types
- Text with formatting
- Multi-select (shift-click or drag)
- Transform operations (move/resize/rotate)
- Duplicate/delete

### Performance & Scalability
- Consistent performance with 500+ objects
- Supports 5+ concurrent users
- No degradation under load
- Smooth interactions at scale

## Section 3: AI Canvas Agent

### Command Breadth & Capability
- 8+ distinct command types
- Covers all categories: creation, manipulation, layout, complex
- Commands are diverse and meaningful

### AI Command Categories (must demonstrate variety):

#### Creation Commands
- "Create a red circle at position 100, 200"
- "Make a 200x300 rectangle"

#### Manipulation Commands
- "Resize the circle to be twice as big"
- "Rotate the text 45 degrees"

#### Layout Commands
- "Arrange these shapes in a horizontal row" (Grouped objects)
- "Space these elements evenly"

#### Complex Commands
- "Create a login form with username and password fields"
- "Make a card layout with title, image, and description"

### Complex Command Execution
- "Create login form" produces 3+ properly arranged elements
- "Make a card layout with title, image, and description" produces card layout with title, image, and description
- Complex layouts execute multi-step plans correctly
- Smart positioning and styling
- Handles ambiguity well

### AI Performance & Reliability
- Sub-2 second responses
- 90%+ accuracy
- Natural UX with feedback
- Shared state works flawlessly
- Multiple users can use AI simultaneously
