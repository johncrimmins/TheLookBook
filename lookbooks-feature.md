Add MyLookBooks features (project repository for canvases)

build strategy:
1. feature 1: mylookbooks. support ability to save a Lookbook, open a Lookbook, and rename them. We should add a feature called mylookbooks and ensure it's vertically sliced in its own directory in /features. add a page and appropriate routing for users to see saved Lookbooks and ability to open a Lookbook from that page. default to this page when a user logs in. the page should be called My Lookbooks and function similar to a like a project repository
2. feature 2: shared lookbooks. support ability for users to share Lookbooks (a LookBook is a shared canvas between users - users can add each other to Lookbooks; user who creates the LookBook is the Owner and the only person who can remove other users from a Lookbook). update the my lookbooks page to reflect two areas: my lookbooks (lookbooks they own) and Collabs (lookbooks they own and have shared AND lookbooks that they have been added to)
