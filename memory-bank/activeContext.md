# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Production Platform - AI Agent Development  
**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks
✅ **Core Platform Complete** - All 5 core features implemented and deployed
- Auth, Presence, Canvas, Objects features fully functional
- Real-time collaboration working (cursors, transforms, deletions)
- DRY architecture with useShapeInteractions hook
- Deployed to Vercel with secured databases
- **ShadCN UI integration complete** - Modern component system

## Recent Changes
- **ShadCN UI Integration Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - Integrated ShadCN component library with Radix UI primitives
  - Refactored all UI components (AuthForm, UserProfile, OnlineUsers, CanvasToolbar, Canvas page)
  - Created barrel export for easy component importing
  - Updated Tailwind config with ShadCN theme variables
  - Professional, consistent design system across all features
- **Memory Bank Cleanup Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - Reduced total lines from ~1,255 to 947 (24% reduction)
  - Removed completed task checklists → replaced with summaries
  - Condensed code examples → using @decorator references
  - Eliminated cross-file duplication of performance targets and tech stack
  - Created `.cursor/rules/memory-bank-cleanup.mdc` for future maintenance
- **Core Platform Successfully Deployed (2025-10-16)**
  - All 5 core features functional and deployed to Vercel
  - Database security rules implemented
  - Delete objects feature with real-time sync
  - Ghost preview bug fixed

## Next Steps: AI Agent Implementation

### 1. AI Agent Feature (Current Priority) ✨
- LangChain integration
- Tool schema definition for shape manipulation
- Command parsing and execution
- Multi-step operation planning
- LangSmith observability
- **Ready to build**: Clean architecture in place via useShapeInteractions

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions and rationale.

### Open Questions for Post-MVP
- Text shape implementation details (font, size, editing)?
- Line/arrow shape implementation?
- Multi-select implementation approach?
- Undo/redo strategy (local vs. synced)?
- AI agent command vocabulary and structure?
- LangSmith observability configuration?

### Considerations
- **Performance:** Needs validation with real concurrent users
- **Architecture Clean:** Ready for AI agent integration via useShapeInteractions
- **Extensibility:** New shapes can be added in ~30 lines of code
- **Security:** Database rules deployed and secured
- **Documentation:** Memory bank optimized and maintainable

## Blockers
None - Core platform deployed, UI standardized, ready for AI agent phase

## Notes
- **Core Platform Complete:** All 5 core features deployed to production
- **UI System:** ShadCN components integrated across all features
- **Firebase Project:** Configured with security rules deployed
- **OpenAI API Key:** Will need for AI agent phase
- **Memory Bank:** Optimized with cursor rule for maintenance
- **Component Library:** 7 ShadCN components installed (Button, Input, Label, Card, Avatar, Badge, Separator)
- **Next Phase:** AI Agent implementation with LangChain + OpenAI
