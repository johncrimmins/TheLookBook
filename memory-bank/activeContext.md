# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Canvas Improvements (Object Manipulation & UX)
**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks

‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 5B-1 (Toolbar Architecture Refactor)
‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 6 (Multi-Select) - Full implementation with 3-store refactor
‚ö†Ô∏è **Incorrect Implementation:** Feature 5B-2 (Flat Layers) - Will be replaced by Feature 7
üìã **Next:** Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers) - PRD ready

### Important Note
Feature 5B-2 was implemented with an **incorrect flat structure** (one object = one layer). This will be replaced by Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System) which implements proper layer grouping (layers contain multiple objects).

## Recent Changes
- **Feature 6: Multi-Select Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - ‚úÖ Marquee selection (click+drag on empty canvas)
  - ‚úÖ Bulk operations: move, delete, duplicate, copy/paste
  - ‚úÖ Multi-select drag (all objects move together)
  - ‚úÖ Context menu integration (shows bulk action counts)
  - ‚úÖ Properties panel integration (shared properties for multiple objects)
  - ‚úÖ Full history/undo support for all bulk operations
  - **Major Refactor:** Split objectsStore into 3 clean stores
    - `selectionStore` - Selection state (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
    - `uiPreferencesStore` - UI preferences (localStorage)
    - `objectsStore` - Domain data only (objects, layer management)
  - **Bug Fixes:** Pan tool, paste format, delete key, right-click selection
- **Feature 5B-2: Incorrect Flat Layers Implementation (2025-10-19)**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented with flat structure (one object = one layer) - INCORRECT
  - Will be replaced by Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System)
  - Reusable components created: LayerThumbnail, rename logic, ShadCN integration
- **PRDs Created (2025-10-19)**
  - Feature 6: Multi-Select (~245 lines) - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
  - Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers System (~226 lines) - Ready for implementation
- **Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Architecture Refactor Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - Left fixed toolbar (60px) with tool selection (V/R/C/H shortcuts)
  - Right pinnable sidebar (320px) with Properties + Layers sections (61/39 split)
  - localStorage persistence, auto-open sidebar on "Format Shape"
  - Generic SidebarPanel component ready for future features


## Next Steps: Phase 1 Canvas Improvements

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Features 1-5: Context Menu, Duplicate, Undo/Redo, Copy/Paste, Z-Index
- ‚úÖ Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Refactor (COMPLETE)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feature 5B-2: Flat Layers (INCORRECT - will be replaced)
- ‚úÖ Feature 6: Multi-Select (COMPLETE)
- üìã Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers (PRD ready - implement next)

### Architectural Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions. Key choices:
- Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
- **Selection state:** Separate selectionStore (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
- **3-Store Pattern:** objectsStore (domain), selectionStore (interaction), uiPreferencesStore (UI)
- Layers: Hierarchical groups containing objects (Feature 7, not flat)
- PRDs: ~220-250 lines each (under cursor rules limit)

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Questions
- **Multi-Select**: Intersecting mode (objects touching box are selected) ‚úÖ
- **Layers**: Hierarchical (layers contain objects), not flat ‚úÖ
- **Build Order**: Feature 6 (Multi-Select) ‚Üí Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers) ‚úÖ
- **Layer Inheritance**: Visibility/lock state inherited from layer to objects (AND logic) ‚úÖ

### Key Considerations
- Feature 5B-2 flat layers code will be refactored/replaced by Feature 7
- Reusable components from 5B-2: LayerThumbnail, rename logic
- Performance needs validation with real concurrent users
- New shapes: ~30 lines each (via useShapeInteractions)

## Blockers
None - Core platform stable, ready for Phase 1 feature implementation

## Notes
- Core platform deployed: 5 features + ShadCN UI
- PRD strategy: Modular ~270-300 line docs
- UI architecture: Left toolbar (60px) + right sidebar (320px, pinnable)
- AI Agent & Lookbooks: Deferred post-Phase 2
