**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks

âœ… **Complete:** Feature 5B-1 (Toolbar Architecture Refactor)
ðŸ“‹ **Next:** Feature 5B-2 (Layers Panel)
- Core platform complete and deployed (5 features + ShadCN UI)
- 6 of 7 Phase 1 features complete (86%)
- **UI Refactor Complete:** Toolbar Architecture Refactor finished
  - 5B-1: Toolbar Architecture Refactor âœ… COMPLETE
  - 5B-2: Layers Panel (ready to implement)

  - Left fixed toolbar (60px) with tool selection (V/R/C/H shortcuts)
  - Right pinnable sidebar (320px) with Properties + Layers sections (61/39 split)
  - localStorage persistence for sidebar state (open/closed, pinned, panel expansions)
  - Auto-open sidebar on "Format Shape" action

## Next Steps: Phase 1 Canvas Improvements

### Implementation Status (6 of 7 Complete)
- âœ… Features 1-5: Context Menu, Duplicate, Undo/Redo, Copy/Paste, Z-Index
- âœ… Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Refactor (COMPLETE - left toolbar + right sidebar)
- ðŸ“‹ Feature 5B-2: Layers Panel (next to implement)
- ðŸ“‹ Feature 6: Multi-Select (PRD pending, ~300 lines)

### Architectural Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions. Key choices:
- Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
- Selection state: Lives in objectsStore
- Layers: Part of objects feature
- PRDs: ~270-300 lines each (modular approach)

## Active Decisions

### Open Questions
- **Multi-Select**: Marquee fully contained vs intersecting? (Recommend intersecting for faster UX)

### Key Considerations
- Performance needs validation with real concurrent users
- Architecture ready for AI agent integration
- New shapes: ~30 lines each (via useShapeInteractions)

## Blockers
None - Core platform stable, ready for Phase 1 feature implementation

## Notes
- Core platform deployed: 5 features + ShadCN UI
- PRD strategy: Modular ~270-300 line docs
- UI architecture: Left toolbar (60px) + right sidebar (320px, pinnable)
- AI Agent & Lookbooks: Deferred post-Phase 2
