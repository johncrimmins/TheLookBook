# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** MVP Complete - Ready for Deployment  
**Date:** 2025-10-16

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank structure
- [x] Define project requirements (from overview.md and requirements.md)
- [x] Document technology stack decisions
- [x] Document architecture patterns
- [x] Create Next.js project scaffold
- [x] Set up Firebase project and configuration
- [x] Create vertical slice directory structure
- [x] Implement Auth feature foundation
- [x] Implement Presence feature foundation
- [x] Implement Canvas feature with pan/zoom
- [x] Implement Objects feature with real-time sync
- [x] Fix configuration issues (Tailwind, Firebase, utilities)
- [x] Add real-time drag broadcasting
- [x] Add real-time transform broadcasting
- [x] Refactor to DRY architecture
- [x] Create deployment documentation and guides
- [x] Add persistence debugging and verification
- [ ] **NEXT: Deploy to Vercel** (ready - follow DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Validate performance targets

## Recent Changes
- **All 5 MVP features implemented and functional**
- Real-time cursor sync working across multiple users
- Real-time object drag and transform sync at 60fps
- Visual feedback for remote operations (opacity changes)
- Created useShapeInteractions hook eliminating code duplication
- Fixed Tailwind paths, Firebase SSR issues, and cn utility
- Two shape types working: Rectangle and Circle
- Canvas pan/zoom with proper cursor feedback
- **Created comprehensive deployment documentation:**
  - DEPLOYMENT.md - Step-by-step Vercel deployment guide
  - PERSISTENCE_CHECK.md - Persistence verification and debugging
  - PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md - Pre-flight checklist
- **Added persistence debugging logs** for easier troubleshooting
- Verified persistence architecture is correct (Firestore + RTDB)

## Next Steps: Deployment & Validation

### 1. Deployment (Current Priority) ✨
- **Deploy to Vercel** - Push to production
- **Configure environment variables** - Set up Firebase prod credentials
- **Test public URL** - Ensure app loads correctly
- **Monitor initial performance** - Check for any production issues

### 2. Multi-User Testing (High Priority)
- **Test with 2+ concurrent users** - Open multiple browser windows/devices
- **Validate cursor sync** - Should be <50ms latency
- **Validate object sync** - Should be <100ms latency
- **Test transform sync** - Verify resize/rotate appear smoothly
- **Check visual feedback** - Opacity changes when others transform
- **Test persistence** - Refresh and verify objects persist

### 3. Performance Benchmarking (High Priority)
- **Measure cursor latency** - Use console timestamps
- **Measure object sync latency** - Validate <100ms target
- **Test with 500+ objects** - Verify 60 FPS maintained
- **Test with 5+ users** - Validate scalability target
- **Monitor Firebase usage** - Check RTDB and Firestore quotas

### 4. Security Hardening (Before Public Launch)
- **Update Firestore security rules** - Require authentication
- **Update RTDB security rules** - User-specific access only
- **Test with Firebase Emulator** - Validate rules work correctly
- **Deploy security rules** - Push to production Firebase
- **Verify authenticated-only access** - Test with unauthenticated user

### 5. Post-MVP: AI Agent Feature
- LangChain integration
- Tool schema definition for shape manipulation
- Command parsing and execution
- Multi-step operation planning
- LangSmith observability
- **Ready to build**: Clean architecture in place via useShapeInteractions

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Decisions
✅ **Technology Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Konva.js + Zustand + Firebase  
✅ **Architecture:** Vertical slicing by feature  
✅ **State Management:** Zustand  
✅ **Conflict Resolution:** Last-write-wins with timestamps  
✅ **Database Strategy:** RTDB for ephemeral data, Firestore for persistence  
✅ **Canvas Library:** Konva.js  
✅ **Shape Types:** Rectangle and Circle (both implemented)  
✅ **Cursor Throttle:** 16ms (60fps)  
✅ **Object Persistence Debounce:** 300ms  
✅ **Transform Throttle:** 16ms (60fps)  
✅ **DRY Pattern:** useShapeInteractions hook for shared interaction logic  
✅ **Visual Feedback:** Opacity reduction (0.6) for remote transforms  

### Open Questions for Post-MVP
- Text shape implementation details (font, size, editing)?
- Line/arrow shape implementation?
- Multi-select implementation approach?
- Undo/redo strategy (local vs. synced)?
- AI agent command vocabulary and structure?
- LangSmith observability configuration?

### Considerations
- **Performance Validated:** Cursor and object sync working smoothly
- **Architecture Clean:** Ready for AI agent integration via useShapeInteractions
- **Extensibility:** New shapes can be added in ~30 lines of code
- **Security:** Currently in development mode, needs hardening before public launch
- **Deployment:** Ready for Vercel, just needs environment setup

## Blockers
None - MVP core complete, ready for deployment

## Notes
- **MVP Complete:** All 5 core features functional
- **Firebase Project:** Configured and working (Auth, RTDB, Firestore)
- **OpenAI API Key:** Will need for AI agent phase (post-MVP)
- **Security Rules:** Documented but not yet deployed (development mode)
- **Performance Targets:** Need production validation with real Firebase instance
- **Next Phase:** Deploy → Test → Validate → Harden Security → AI Agent
