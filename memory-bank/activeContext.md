# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Phase 2 (AI Agent) - PRD 1 Implementation Starting
**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks

‚úÖ **Complete:** All Phase 1 & Phase 3 features (Lookbooks + Canvas improvements)
‚úÖ **Complete:** AI Agent PRDs created (PRD 1: Basic Foundation, PRD 2: Complex Commands)
üìã **Next:** Implement PRD 1 - AI Agent Basic Foundation
  - Install LangChain + OpenAI dependencies
  - Build API route with Firebase auth
  - Create chat UI (AIChatPanel component)
  - Implement manipulateCanvas tool (create operation only)
  - Test simple commands: create rectangle, circle, text
  - Verify LangSmith tracing

### Important Note
Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System) has replaced Feature 5B-2's incorrect flat structure. Layers now properly group multiple objects (Photoshop-style), with visibility/lock inheritance and full Firestore sync.

## Recent Changes
- **AI Agent PRDs Created (2025-10-19)**

  - **Architecture:**
    - New feature: `src/features/lookbooks/`
    - Zustand store: `lookbooksStore.ts`
    - Service: `lookbooksService.ts` (handles all Firestore operations)
    - 6 components: EmptyState, CreateButton, LookbookCard, LookbookContextMenu, LookbookGrid, page
    - 2 hooks: `useLookbooks`, `useLookbookOperations`
    - Utility: `nameGenerator.ts` (Adjective + Noun pattern)
  - **Firestore Schema:**
    - `canvases/{canvasId}` - Lookbook metadata (name, owner, timestamps)
    - `users/{userId}/canvases/{canvasId}` - User's canvas index
  - **Bug Fixes:**
    - Fixed Firebase initialization pattern (client-side `getDb()`)
    - Fixed user ID access (`user.id` vs `user.uid`)
    - Fixed Firestore rules for authenticated user access
  - **UI Components Added:**
    - ShadCN: ContextMenu, AlertDialog (+ deps installed)

  - ‚úÖ "Move to Layer" via context menu submenu
  - ‚úÖ LayerModal for bulk object assignment with search
  - ‚úÖ Real-time Firestore sync for all layer operations
  - ‚úÖ Integration with multi-select (marquee respects layer state)
  - ‚úÖ Migration: objects without layerId auto-assigned to Default Layer
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues:** Minor bugs need testing/fixes
  - **Files Created:** 5 new (Layer, LayerList, LayerModal, CreateLayerButton, layer.ts)
  - **Files Updated:** 9 files (stores, services, components)
- **Feature 6: Multi-Select Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - ‚úÖ Marquee selection (click+drag on empty canvas)
  - ‚úÖ Bulk operations: move, delete, duplicate, copy/paste

  - ‚úÖ Context menu integration (shows bulk action counts)
  - ‚úÖ Properties panel integration (shared properties for multiple objects)
  - ‚úÖ Full history/undo support for all bulk operations
  - **Major Refactor:** Split objectsStore into 3 clean stores
    - `selectionStore` - Selection state (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
    - `uiPreferencesStore` - UI preferences (localStorage)
    - `objectsStore` - Domain data only (objects, layer management)
  - **Bug Fixes:** Pan tool, paste format, delete key, right-click selection



## Next Steps: Phase 1 Canvas Improvements

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Features 1-5: Context Menu, Duplicate, Undo/Redo, Copy/Paste, Z-Index
- ‚úÖ Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Refactor (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Feature 6: Multi-Select (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers System (COMPLETE - replaces 5B-2)
- üìã **Next:** Bug fixes, testing, Phase 2 planning

### Architectural Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions. Key choices:
- Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
- **Selection state:** Separate selectionStore (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
- **3-Store Pattern:** objectsStore (domain), selectionStore (interaction), uiPreferencesStore (UI)
- Layers: Hierarchical groups containing objects (Feature 7, not flat)
- PRDs: ~220-250 lines each (under cursor rules limit)

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Questions
- **Multi-Select**: Intersecting mode (objects touching box are selected) ‚úÖ
- **Layers**: Hierarchical (layers contain objects), not flat ‚úÖ
- **Build Order**: Feature 6 (Multi-Select) ‚Üí Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers) ‚úÖ
- **Layer Inheritance**: Visibility/lock state inherited from layer to objects (AND logic) ‚úÖ

### Key Considerations
- Feature 7 complete but needs testing for minor bugs
- Performance needs validation with real concurrent users
- Layer expanded state persisted to localStorage
- New shapes: ~30 lines each (via useShapeInteractions)

## Blockers
None - Core platform stable, ready for Phase 1 feature implementation

## Notes
- Core platform deployed: 5 features + ShadCN UI
- PRD strategy: Modular ~220-285 line docs (simplified, no testing/validation sections)
- UI architecture: Left toolbar (60px) + right sidebar (320px, pinnable)
- **Phase 1:** Complete (Canvas improvements, toolbar, layers, multi-select)
- **Phase 2:** AI Agent - PRD 1 ready for implementation ‚è≥
- **Phase 3:** Complete (My Lookbooks + Shared Lookbooks)

## Upcoming Features
**Next: AI Agent PRD 1** (3-4 days estimated)
- Basic foundation with simple shape creation
- LangChain + OpenAI + LangSmith integration
- Unified `manipulateCanvas` tool architecture
- Foundation for PRD 2 complex commands
