# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ - Planning Phase 2 (AI Agent) & Future Phases
**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks

‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 5B-1 (Toolbar Architecture Refactor)
‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 6 (Multi-Select) - Full implementation with 3-store refactor
‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System) - Replaces Feature 5B-2
‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 8 & 9 PRDs (My Lookbooks + Shared Lookbooks)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues:** Minor bugs in layer implementation need testing
üìã **Next:** Bug fixes, then Phase 2 (AI Agent) or Phase 3 (Lookbooks)

### Important Note
Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System) has replaced Feature 5B-2's incorrect flat structure. Layers now properly group multiple objects (Photoshop-style), with visibility/lock inheritance and full Firestore sync.

## Recent Changes
- **Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers System Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - ‚úÖ Default Layer (auto-created, cannot be deleted/renamed)
  - ‚úÖ Create, rename, delete layers with auto-generated names
  - ‚úÖ Expand/collapse layers showing nested objects with 32x32 thumbnails
  - ‚úÖ Visibility & lock inheritance (AND logic: object + layer)
  - ‚úÖ "Move to Layer" via context menu submenu
  - ‚úÖ LayerModal for bulk object assignment with search
  - ‚úÖ Real-time Firestore sync for all layer operations
  - ‚úÖ Integration with multi-select (marquee respects layer state)
  - ‚úÖ Migration: objects without layerId auto-assigned to Default Layer
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues:** Minor bugs need testing/fixes
  - **Files Created:** 5 new (Layer, LayerList, LayerModal, CreateLayerButton, layer.ts)
  - **Files Updated:** 9 files (stores, services, components)
- **Feature 6: Multi-Select Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - ‚úÖ Marquee selection (click+drag on empty canvas)
  - ‚úÖ Bulk operations: move, delete, duplicate, copy/paste
  - ‚úÖ Multi-select drag (all objects move together)
  - ‚úÖ Context menu integration (shows bulk action counts)
  - ‚úÖ Properties panel integration (shared properties for multiple objects)
  - ‚úÖ Full history/undo support for all bulk operations
  - **Major Refactor:** Split objectsStore into 3 clean stores
    - `selectionStore` - Selection state (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
    - `uiPreferencesStore` - UI preferences (localStorage)
    - `objectsStore` - Domain data only (objects, layer management)
  - **Bug Fixes:** Pan tool, paste format, delete key, right-click selection



## Next Steps: Phase 1 Canvas Improvements

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Features 1-5: Context Menu, Duplicate, Undo/Redo, Copy/Paste, Z-Index
- ‚úÖ Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Refactor (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Feature 6: Multi-Select (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers System (COMPLETE - replaces 5B-2)
- üìã **Next:** Bug fixes, testing, Phase 2 planning

### Architectural Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions. Key choices:
- Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
- **Selection state:** Separate selectionStore (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
- **3-Store Pattern:** objectsStore (domain), selectionStore (interaction), uiPreferencesStore (UI)
- Layers: Hierarchical groups containing objects (Feature 7, not flat)
- PRDs: ~220-250 lines each (under cursor rules limit)

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Questions
- **Multi-Select**: Intersecting mode (objects touching box are selected) ‚úÖ
- **Layers**: Hierarchical (layers contain objects), not flat ‚úÖ
- **Build Order**: Feature 6 (Multi-Select) ‚Üí Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers) ‚úÖ
- **Layer Inheritance**: Visibility/lock state inherited from layer to objects (AND logic) ‚úÖ

### Key Considerations
- Feature 7 complete but needs testing for minor bugs
- Performance needs validation with real concurrent users
- Layer expanded state persisted to localStorage
- New shapes: ~30 lines each (via useShapeInteractions)

## Blockers
None - Core platform stable, ready for Phase 1 feature implementation

## Notes
- Core platform deployed: 5 features + ShadCN UI
- PRD strategy: Modular ~220-260 line docs (context-efficient)
- UI architecture: Left toolbar (60px) + right sidebar (320px, pinnable)
- **Phase 2:** AI Agent (future)
- **Phase 3:** Lookbooks (Feature 8 & 9 PRDs ready)

## Upcoming Features (PRDs Ready)
- **Feature 8:** My Lookbooks (253 lines) - Multi-canvas project repository
- **Feature 9:** Shared Lookbooks (264 lines) - Collaboration & ownership
- **Build order:** Feature 7 ‚Üí Feature 8 ‚Üí Feature 9 (dependencies resolved)
