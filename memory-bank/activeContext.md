# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Canvas Improvements (Object Manipulation & UX)
**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks
ðŸ”„ **Phase 1: Canvas Improvements** - Enhancing object manipulation with industry-standard features
- Core platform complete and deployed (5 features + ShadCN UI)
- Focus shifted from AI agent to user experience improvements
- Building: Right-click context menu, duplicate, undo/redo, copy/paste, layers, multi-select
- Feature roadmap documented in `new-features-roadmap.md`
- Feature PRD for Context Menu complete: `docs/feature-prd-context-menu.md`

## Recent Changes
- **All Phase 1 PRDs Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - Created all 7 feature PRDs in `/tasks/` folder (1,754 lines total)
  - Architectural simplifications: Clipboard as utilities, selection in objects store, layers in objects feature
  - Roadmap documented in `new-features-roadmap.md`
  - Implementation order: Context Menu â†’ Undo/Redo â†’ Duplicate â†’ Copy/Paste â†’ Z-Index â†’ Layer Panel â†’ Multi-Select
  - All PRDs under 300 lines, no verbose testing sections
- **ShadCN UI Integration Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - Integrated ShadCN component library with Radix UI primitives
  - Refactored all UI components (AuthForm, UserProfile, OnlineUsers, CanvasToolbar, Canvas page)
  - Created barrel export for easy component importing
  - Updated Tailwind config with ShadCN theme variables
  - Professional, consistent design system across all features


## Next Steps: Phase 1 Canvas Improvements

### All 7 Phase 1 PRDs Complete âœ…
1. **Context Menu** - `tasks/prd-context-menu.md` (174 lines)
2. **Duplicate Object** - `tasks/prd-duplicate-object.md` (202 lines)
3. **Undo/Redo** - `tasks/prd-undo-redo.md` (278 lines)
4. **Copy/Paste** - `tasks/prd-copy-paste.md` (224 lines)
5. **Z-Index** - `tasks/prd-z-index.md` (287 lines)
6. **Layer Panel** - `tasks/prd-layer-panel.md` (289 lines)
7. **Multi-Select** - `tasks/prd-multi-select.md` (300 lines)

### Architectural Decisions Made
- **Clipboard**: Shared utilities (`shared/lib/clipboard.ts`), not separate feature
- **Selection State**: Lives in `objectsStore`, not canvas store
- **Layers**: Part of objects feature, not separate feature
- Total: 1,754 lines across 7 PRDs

### Ready for Implementation
- Feature 1 (Context Menu) is next to implement
- All PRDs follow vertical slice architecture
- All integration points documented

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions and rationale.

### Open Questions for Implementation
- **Context Menu**: Use ShadCN Popover for color picker or react-color library?
- **Context Menu**: Delete action confirmation or rely on undo/redo? (Recommend no confirmation)
- **Undo/Redo**: Store full snapshots or deltas? (Recommend full snapshots - simpler)
- **Layer Panel**: Empty layer handling - keep or auto-delete?
- **Multi-Select**: Marquee fully contained vs intersecting? (Recommend intersecting - faster UX)

### Considerations
- **Performance:** Needs validation with real concurrent users
- **Architecture Clean:** Ready for AI agent integration via useShapeInteractions
- **Extensibility:** New shapes can be added in ~30 lines of code
- **Security:** Database rules deployed and secured
- **Documentation:** Memory bank optimized and maintainable

## Blockers
None - Core platform stable, ready for Phase 1 feature implementation

## Notes
- **Core Platform Complete:** All 5 core features deployed to production
- **UI System:** ShadCN components integrated across all features
- **Firebase Project:** Configured with security rules deployed
- **Roadmap:** `new-features-roadmap.md` - 7 features, 2 phases
- **PRDs Complete:** All 7 Phase 1 PRDs in `/tasks/` folder
- **Architecture:** Clipboard as utilities, selection in objects store, layers in objects feature
- **Memory Bank:** Optimized with cursor rule for maintenance
- **Component Library:** 7 ShadCN components installed (Button, Input, Label, Card, Avatar, Badge, Separator)
- **AI Agent:** Deferred to post-Phase 2 (user preference)
