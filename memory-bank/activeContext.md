# Active Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Focus
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Canvas Improvements (Object Manipulation & UX)
**Date:** 2025-10-19

### Immediate Tasks

‚úÖ **Complete:** Feature 5B-1 (Toolbar Architecture Refactor)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Incorrect Implementation:** Feature 5B-2 (Flat Layers) - Will be replaced by Feature 7
üìã **Next:** Feature 6 (Multi-Select) - PRD ready
üìã **Then:** Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers) - PRD ready

### Important Note
Feature 5B-2 was implemented with an **incorrect flat structure** (one object = one layer). This will be replaced by Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System) which implements proper layer grouping (layers contain multiple objects).

## Recent Changes
- **Feature 5B-2: Incorrect Flat Layers Implementation (2025-10-19)**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented with flat structure (one object = one layer) - INCORRECT
  - Will be replaced by Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers System)
  - Reusable components created: LayerThumbnail, rename logic, ShadCN integration
- **PRDs Created (2025-10-19)**
  - Feature 6: Multi-Select (~245 lines) - Ready for implementation
  - Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers System (~226 lines) - Ready for implementation
  - Build order: Feature 6 first, then Feature 7
- **Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Architecture Refactor Complete (2025-10-19)**
  - Left fixed toolbar (60px) with tool selection (V/R/C/H shortcuts)
  - Right pinnable sidebar (320px) with Properties + Layers sections (61/39 split)
  - localStorage persistence, auto-open sidebar on "Format Shape"
  - Generic SidebarPanel component ready for future features


## Next Steps: Phase 1 Canvas Improvements

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Features 1-5: Context Menu, Duplicate, Undo/Redo, Copy/Paste, Z-Index
- ‚úÖ Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Refactor (COMPLETE)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feature 5B-2: Flat Layers (INCORRECT - will be replaced)
- üìã Feature 6: Multi-Select (PRD ready - implement next)
- üìã Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers (PRD ready - implement after Feature 6)

### Architectural Decisions
See systemPatterns.md for all technical decisions. Key choices:
- Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
- Selection state: Lives in objectsStore (Feature 6)
- Layers: Hierarchical groups containing objects (Feature 7, not flat)
- PRDs: ~220-250 lines each (under cursor rules limit)

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Questions
- **Multi-Select**: Intersecting mode (objects touching box are selected) ‚úÖ
- **Layers**: Hierarchical (layers contain objects), not flat ‚úÖ
- **Build Order**: Feature 6 (Multi-Select) ‚Üí Feature 7 (Hierarchical Layers) ‚úÖ
- **Layer Inheritance**: Visibility/lock state inherited from layer to objects (AND logic) ‚úÖ

### Key Considerations
- Feature 5B-2 flat layers code will be refactored/replaced by Feature 7
- Reusable components from 5B-2: LayerThumbnail, rename logic
- Performance needs validation with real concurrent users
- New shapes: ~30 lines each (via useShapeInteractions)

## Blockers
None - Core platform stable, ready for Phase 1 feature implementation

## Notes
- Core platform deployed: 5 features + ShadCN UI
- PRD strategy: Modular ~270-300 line docs
- UI architecture: Left toolbar (60px) + right sidebar (320px, pinnable)
- AI Agent & Lookbooks: Deferred post-Phase 2
