# Product Context: CollabCanvas v3

## Why This Exists
CollabCanvas enables teams to collaborate on visual design and planning in real-time with the power of AI assistance. It solves the problem of disconnected design workflows and brings natural language control to canvas manipulation.

## Problems Solved

1. **Multiplayer Design Collaboration**
   - Real-time collaboration infrastructure with instant cursor/edit sync
   - Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

2. **Complex Canvas Manipulation**
   - AI agent (future) allows natural language commands
   - Automates repetitive positioning and layout tasks

3. **State Persistence & Reliability**
   - Canvas state persists through disconnects
   - Seamless automatic reconnection

## How It Works

### Two-Phase Architecture
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Build bulletproof collaborative infrastructure
2. **Phase 2:** Layer AI agent on top for natural language control

### Technical Flow
1. User authenticates via Firebase Auth
2. Joins canvas session with presence tracking (Firebase RTDB)
3. Cursor movements broadcast in real-time (<50ms latency)
4. Object creation/manipulation syncs across users (<100ms latency)
5. State persists to Firestore on changes
6. AI agent (future) receives commands and manipulates canvas via function calls

### Core Features

**Platform (Complete) ✅**
- Auth, real-time cursors, presence awareness
- Canvas operations (pan, zoom, shapes)
- Object sync (<100ms), state persistence
- ShadCN UI design system

**Phase 1 (In Progress)**
- Toolbar refactor, layers panel, multi-select

**Future**
- AI agent: Natural language canvas manipulation
- Advanced shapes: text, lines, styling
- Complex layouts via AI commands

## User Experience Goals

### Target Users
- Design teams collaborating on visual projects
- Product teams doing planning and wireframing
- Anyone needing real-time visual collaboration
- Users wanting to control design tools with natural language

### User Journey
**Core Platform (Complete):**
1. Sign in → land on canvas with smooth pan/zoom
2. See other users' cursors in real-time
3. Create/drag shapes with zero lag
4. Canvas state persists through refreshes
5. Collaborate seamlessly with 5+ users

**With AI Agent (Future):**
- Natural language commands create complex layouts
- All users see AI-generated results in real-time
- Iterative refinement with follow-up commands

### Design Principles
1. **Performance First:** <50ms cursor, <100ms object sync
2. **Reliability:** Never lose work, graceful disconnects
3. **Scalability:** Architecture supports AI and advanced features
4. **Delight:** Smooth animations, clear feedback, professional feel
5. **Simplicity & Elegance:** Simple, elegant architecture with elegant implementations
## Value Proposition

**Core Platform:** A rock-solid collaborative canvas with professional UI that proves the multiplayer infrastructure works flawlessly. Production-ready foundation for advanced features.

**With AI Agent:** The first real-time collaborative canvas that responds to natural language commands, making complex layouts and repetitive tasks effortless while maintaining perfect sync across all users.
