## What's Left to Build

### Core Platform Complete âœ…
All 5 core features plus UI system implemented:
- âœ… Project Setup (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Firebase)
- âœ… Auth Feature (Firebase Auth, protected routes)
- âœ… Presence Feature (Real-time cursors, online users)
- âœ… Canvas Feature (Pan/zoom, viewport management)
- âœ… Objects Feature (Rectangles, circles, transforms, DRY architecture)
- âœ… Deployment (Vercel deployment successful)
- âœ… Delete Objects (Keyboard shortcuts with real-time sync)
- âœ… ShadCN UI Integration (Modern component system)

### Pending Validation
- [ ] Test with 2+ concurrent users (performance validation)
- [ ] Verify cursor sync <50ms target
- [ ] Verify object sync <100ms target

### Phase 1: Canvas Improvements (Planning Complete)

- [x] **All PRDs Created** (7 features, 1,754 lines total)
  - [x] Feature 1: Context Menu (`tasks/prd-context-menu.md` - 174 lines)

  - [x] Feature 5B: Layer Panel (`tasks/prd-layer-panel.md` - 289 lines)
  - [x] Feature 6: Multi-Select (`tasks/prd-multi-select.md` - 300 lines)

- [x] **Architectural Decisions Made**
  - [x] Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
  - [x] Selection state: Lives in objects store
  - [x] Layers: Part of objects feature

- [ ] **Implementation** (2/7 complete)
  - [x] Feature 1: Context Menu - COMPLETE
    - Traditional right-click action menu
    - Properties panel with color picker, numeric inputs
    - Advanced properties (position X/Y, opacity)
    - Real-time sync for all property changes
  - [x] Feature 3: Undo/Redo - COMPLETE
    - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y) with toolbar buttons
    - Per-user history stacks (50-action depth)
    - All operations supported (create, delete, move, resize, rotate, properties)
    - Session-based (clears on refresh - standard pattern)
    - Fixed drag position tracking for correct undo behavior
  - [ ] Feature 2: Duplicate (1-2 days) - Next priority
  - [ ] Feature 4: Copy/Paste (3-4 days)
  - [ ] Feature 5A: Z-Index (2-3 days)
  - [ ] Feature 5B: Layer Panel (5-7 days)
  - [ ] Feature 6: Multi-Select (5-7 days)

### Future: AI Agent (Deferred Post-Phase 2)
- [ ] LangChain integration
- [ ] OpenAI function calling
- [ ] 8+ command types
- [ ] Undo/redo for AI commands

## In Progress
âœ… **Feature 1 Complete:** Context Menu with properties panel  
âœ… **Feature 3 Complete:** Undo/Redo with keyboard shortcuts and drag tracking  
ðŸ“‹ **Next:** Feature 2 implementation (Duplicate Object)
