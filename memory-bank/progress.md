# Progress: CollabCanvas v3

## Current Status
**Phase:** Phase 3 - Lookbooks (Features 8 & 9 Complete ✅)
**Focus:** Multi-Canvas Project Management with Collaboration
**Date:** 2025-10-19

## What Works
✅ **Core Platform:** All 5 features deployed (auth, presence, canvas, objects, history)
✅ **Real-Time Collaboration:** <100ms object sync, <50ms cursor sync, 60fps transforms
✅ **Phase 1 Features Complete:** Context menu, duplicate, undo/redo, copy/paste, z-index, toolbar refactor
✅ **UI System:** ShadCN component library integrated (Tooltip, ScrollArea added)
✅ **Security:** Firestore and RTDB rules secured with authentication
✅ **Modern UI:** Left toolbar (60px) + right pinnable sidebar (320px) with state persistence
✅ **Testing:** Chrome DevTools MCP integrated for automated performance/bug testing
   - Agent guide: `docs/testing/agent-testing-guide.md` (for dedicated testing sessions)
   - Test modules: `docs/testing/performance.md`, `collaboration.md`, `network-reliability.md`, `monitoring.md`
   - Bug log: `docs/testing/bugs-found.md`

## What's Left to Build

### Core Platform Complete ✅
All 5 core features deployed: Auth, Presence, Canvas, Objects, History + ShadCN UI

### Pending Validation
- [ ] Test with 2+ concurrent users (performance validation)
- [ ] Verify cursor sync <50ms target
- [ ] Verify object sync <100ms target

### Phase 1: Canvas Improvements (Complete ✅)
- ✅ Features 1-5: Context Menu, Duplicate, Undo/Redo, Copy/Paste, Z-Index
- ✅ Feature 5B-1: Toolbar Architecture Refactor
- ✅ Feature 6: Multi-Select (Marquee selection, bulk operations, 3-store refactor)
- ✅ Feature 7: Hierarchical Layers System (Replaces 5B-2, minor bugs to fix)

**Architectural Decisions:**
- Clipboard: Shared utilities, not separate feature
- **3-Store Pattern:** objectsStore (domain data), selectionStore (local interaction), uiPreferencesStore (UI)
- Selection state: LOCAL ONLY, never persisted
- Layers: Part of objects feature


## In Progress
📋 **AI Agent PRD 1:** Basic Foundation (Ready for Implementation)
  - Status: PRDs created and reviewed
  - Next: Install dependencies, build API route, create chat UI
  - Files: `tasks/prd-ai-agent-basic.md` (260 lines)
  - Goal: Simple shape creation with LangChain + OpenAI

## Known Issues
- **Bug #1 (CRITICAL):** Canvas crash - presence.map is not a function (CanvasToolbar.tsx:106)
- **Bug #2 (HIGH):** generateLayerName import error (LayerItem.tsx, useObjects.ts)
- Performance benchmarks need validation with real concurrent users
- See `docs/testing/bugs-found.md` for automated test findings

## Recent Updates

### 2025-10-19 - AI Agent PRDs Created ✅
**Status:** PRDs reviewed and ready for implementation

**PRD 1: Basic Foundation** (~260 lines)
- **Goal:** Validate AI architecture with simple shape creation
- **Commands:** Create rectangle, circle, text
- **Architecture:**
  - Unified `manipulateCanvas` tool (only "create" operation in PRD 1)
  - Simple object memory Map (in-memory, stores labels)
  - Session-based persistence (sessionStorage only)
  - 12 files to create (combined from 17)
- **Key Decisions:**
  - No validation/testing sections (manual testing)
  - No complex persistence logic (sessionStorage, no TTL)
  - Combined files: AIChatPanel (all UI), aiService (canvas + API), useAIChat (state + persistence)
- **Dependencies:** LangChain, @langchain/openai, openai
- **Foundation for PRD 2:** Object memory Map, extensible tool schema, AI service layer

**PRD 2: Complex Commands** (~285 lines)
- **Extends PRD 1:** Adds operations to `manipulateCanvas` (move, resize, delete, batch, layout)
- **Semantic References:** Query object memory by label/description
- **Multi-Step:** "Create login form" → 6 objects with proper positioning
- **Batch Operations:** "Create 3x3 grid" → 9 circles in grid layout
- **Smart Layouts:** Align, distribute, arrange algorithms
- **Zero Refactoring:** PRD 1 code unchanged, pure extension

**Dependency Resolution:**
- ✅ Tool name consistent (manipulateCanvas in both)
- ✅ Object memory structure extensible
- ✅ Clean iterative build strategy
- ✅ No breaking changes between PRDs

**Files Created:**
- `tasks/prd-ai-agent-basic.md`

- "Move to Layer" via context menu submenu with checkmarks
- LayerModal for bulk object assignment with search (20+ objects)
- Real-time Firestore sync for all layer CRUD operations
- Integration with multi-select (marquee respects layer visibility/lock)
- Migration: objects without layerId auto-assigned to Default Layer
- Layer expanded state persisted to localStorage

**Architecture:**
- **5 NEW files:** Layer.tsx, LayerList.tsx, LayerModal.tsx, CreateLayerButton.tsx, layer.ts

- Context menu integration (shows "Delete All (3)", "Duplicate All (3)", etc.)
- Properties panel multi-select UI (shared properties, count badge)
- Full history/undo support for all bulk operations
- Smart selection (right-click preserves multi-selection)

**Major Architecture Refactor - 3-Store Pattern:**
- **`selectionStore.ts`** - Selection state (LOCAL ONLY, never persisted)
  - selectedIds, selectObject, selectMultiple, clearSelection
  - Basic bulk operations for store-level logic
- **`uiPreferencesStore.ts`** - UI preferences (localStorage persisted)
  - Sidebar open/closed/pinned, panel expanded/collapsed
  - ONLY store using localStorage (clear persistence boundary)
- **`objectsStore.ts`** - Domain data only (refactored)
  - Objects data, layer management
  - NO selection state, NO UI preferences


**Files Created:** 2 new stores, 1 component (SelectionBox)
**Files Updated:** 8 files (Canvas, page, ObjectRenderer, RightSidebar, ContextMenu, useObjects, clipboard, etc.)

### 2025-10-19 - PRDs Created ✅

**State Persistence:**
- localStorage for all sidebar state (open/closed, pinned, panel expansions)
- 4 storage keys: sidebar_open, sidebar_pinned, properties_expanded, layers_expanded
- State restores correctly on page refresh

**UX Improvements:**
- Auto-open sidebar when "Format Shape" clicked
- Smooth animations (<300ms transitions)
- Outside click closes unpinned sidebar

**Bug Fixes:**
- getUserInitials() handles undefined displayName
